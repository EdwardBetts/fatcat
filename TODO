- tests are picking up config.py instead of using setUp()

helpers/ORM and test
x files
x containers
- citations
x create from crossref dict (naive)
- "hydrated" get: release, creator, container
- populate_random_edit; push edit to live
- helpers with change logging (hook?)

review
- should release point to work? I think not
- remove 'state' and 'redirect_id' from all revision tables

later:
- crossref json import script/benchmark
    => maybe both "raw" and string-dedupe?
- public IDs are UUID (sqlite hack?)
