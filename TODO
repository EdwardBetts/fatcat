## In Progress

- authentication!
    => unit tests
    => refactor to use other macaroons lib
    => env key passing
    => RBAC infra
    => wire up fatcatd (env, cli)
    => check permissions everywhere
    => toml or similar key-right
- webface auth

## Next Up

- cargo update (rust deps)
- pipenv update (python deps)
- remove the concept of "active editgroup", and simplify autoaccept batch path
- fix returned error messages; should return type (shortname), and then actual
  message/description
- handle wip entities in web UI
- elastic inserter should handle deletions and redirects; if state isn't
  active, delete the document
    => don't delete, just store state. but need to "blank" redirects and WIP so
       they don't show up in results
    => refactor inserter to be a class (eg, for command line use)
    => end-to-end test of this behavior?

## Ideas

- fast path to skip recursive redirect checks for bulk inserts
- when getting "wip" entities, require a parameter ("allow_wip"), else get a
  404
- consider dropping CORE identifier
- maybe better 'success' return message? eg, "success: true" flag
- idea: allow users to generate their own editgroup UUIDs, to reduce a round
  trips and "hanging" editgroups (created but never edited)
- API: allow deletion of empty, un-accepted editgroups
- refactor API schema for some entity-generic methos (eg, history, edit
  operations) to take entity type as a URL path param. greatly reduce macro
  foolery and method count/complexity, and ease creation of new entities
    => /{entity}/edit/{edit_id}
    => /{entity}/{ident}/redirects
    => /{entity}/{ident}/history

## Production blockers

- refactors and correctness in rust/TODO
- importers have editor accounts and include editgroup metadata
- crossref importer sets release_type as "stub" when appropriate
- real authentication and authorization
- metrics, jwt, config, sentry
- importers:  don't insert wayback links with short timestamps

## Metadata Import

- cleaning/matching: https://ftfy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- manifest: multiple URLs per SHA1
- crossref: relations ("is-preprint-of")
- crossref: two phase: no citations, then matched citations (via DOI table)
- container import (extra?): lang, region, subject
- crossref: filter works
    => content-type whitelist
    => title length and title/slug blacklist
    => at least one author (?)
    => make this a method on Release object
    => or just set release_type as "stub"?

new importers:
- pubmed (medline) (filtered)
    => and/or, use pubmed ID lookups on crossref import
- arxiv.org
- DOAJ
- CORE (filtered)
- semantic scholar (up to 39 million; includes author de-dupe)

## Entity/Edit Lifecycle

- commenting and accepting editgroups
- editgroup state machine?

## Guide / Book / Style

- release_type, release_status, url.rel schemas (enforced in API)
- more+better terms+policies: https://tosdr.org/index.html

## Fun Features

- "save paper now"
    => is it in GWB? if not, SPN
    => get hash + url from GWB, verify mimetype acceptable
    => is file in fatcat?
    => what about HBase? GROBID?
    => create edit, redirect user to editgroup submit page
- python client tool and library in pypi
    => or maybe rust?
- bibtext (etc) export

## Schema / Entity Fields

- arxiv_id field (keep flip-flopping)
- original_title field (?)
- FileSet and WebCapture entities
- `doi` field for containers (at least for "journal" type; maybe for "series"
  as well?)
- `retracted`, `translation`, and perhaps `corrected` as flags on releases,
  instead of release_status?
- 'part-of' relation for releases (release to release) and possibly containers
- `container-type` field for containers (journal, conference, book series, etc)

## Other / Backburner

- refactor openapi schema to use shared response types
- consider using "HTTP 202: Accepted" for entity-mutating calls
- basic python hbase/elastic matcher
  => takes sha1 keys
  => checks fatcat API + hbase
  => if not matched yet, tries elastic search
  => simple ~exact match heuristic
  => proof-of-concept, no tests
- add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=3600";
    => 12 hours? 24?
- haproxy for rate-limiting
- feature flags: consul?
- secrets: vault?
- "authn" microservice: https://keratin.tech/
