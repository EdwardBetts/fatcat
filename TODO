## Schema / Alignment / Scope

- abstracts! as files? separate table? format (latex, html, etc)?
- work_type, release_type, release_status
- multiple URLs
- other identifiers (just in extra?)

name ref: https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-personal-names

## High-Level Priorities

- bulk loading of releases, files, containers, creators
- manual editing of containers and releases (web interface)
- accurate auto-matching matching of containers (eg, via ISSN)
- full database dump and reload (import/export)


## Other

- kong or oauth2_proxy for auth, rate-limit, etc
- "authn" microservice: https://keratin.tech/
- PUT for mid-edit revisions
- 'parent rev' for revisions (vs. container parent)
- "submit" status for editgroups?

api:
- all files for a given release

review
- what does openlibrary API look like?
- add a 'live' (or 'immutable') flag to revision tables

CSL:

- perhaps a "create from CSL" endpoint?
