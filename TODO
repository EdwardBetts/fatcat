## High-Level Priorities

- bulk loading of releases, files, containers, creators
- manual editing of containers and releases
- accurate auto-matching matching of containers (eg, via ISSN)
- full database dump and reload


## Other

- kong or oauth2_proxy for auth, rate-limit, etc
- "authn" microservice: https://keratin.tech/
- PUT for mid-edit revisions
- 'parent rev' for revisions (vs. container parent)
- "submit" status for editgroups?

api:
- all files for a given release

review
- what does openlibrary API look like?
- add a 'live' (or 'immutable') flag to revision tables

CSL:
- https://citationstyles.org/
- https://github.com/citation-style-language/documentation/blob/master/primer.txt
- https://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-json/markup.html
- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/blob/master/csl-types.rnc
- perhaps a "create from CSL" endpoint?
