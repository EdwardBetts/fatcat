Avoiding ORM and splitting into two apps seems to be like making water flow up
hill. Going to just make this a generic flask-sqlalchemy thing for now.

- backend test setup: generate temporary database, insert rows (?)

backend/api:
- first-rev schema
- json_blob table (by sha1)
- create work, release, etc
- get by ID

tooling:
- query tool: by fc id, doi/issn/etc

importers:
- crossref
- pubmed
- dblp
- "norwegian" journal list
- scihub hash list
- author list?

webface:
- creators and editors for:
    works
    releases
    files
    people
    containers

#### Open Questions

How to create multiple cross-referenced entities at the same time? Eg, work and
release, with release referencing work. work_id isn't allocated/indicated until
merge-time. As a work-around, could have a temporary work_rev_id column which
gets overridden during merge.

Mechanism for skipping edit group stage. Propose always having edit rows
generated, containing appropriate metadata, but certain bots can skip creation
of edit group.
