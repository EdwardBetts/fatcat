- editor_id vs. editor username; return editor_id (in addition to name?)

later:
- editgroup: state to track review status?
- re-implement old python tests
- enforce "no editing if editgroup accepted" behavior
- refactor entity creation/editing (DRY)
- refactor to allow Result<> in all handlers
- real auth
- metrics, jwt, config, sentry
- ansible/deployment/DNS story
- refactor logging; use slog

schema/api questions:
- url table (for files)
- get works/releases by creator
- "types"
- define release field stuff
- what should entity POST return? include both the entity and the edit?
- PUTs (updates) to entities
