- database_entity_crud -> api_entity_crud
- merge autoaccept branch in with http-verbs branch
- fatcat_api -> fatcat_api_schema (or spec? models? types?)
- fatcat -> fatcat-api-server
- refactor rev creation (from an entity) into it's own function, across the board
    => attach to database module structs?
    => should make cockroachdb compatible (single use of CTE)
    => usable from both "update" and "create"
- editgroup param to update
    => also for creation? for consistency

- editor_id vs. editor username; return editor_id (in addition to name?)

later:
- editgroup: state to track review status?
- re-implement old python tests
- enforce "no editing if editgroup accepted" behavior
- refactor entity creation/editing (DRY)
- refactor to allow Result<> in all handlers
- real auth
- metrics, jwt, config, sentry
- ansible/deployment/DNS story
- refactor logging; use slog

schema/api questions:
- url table (for files)
- get works/releases by creator
- "types"
- define release field stuff
- what should entity POST return? include both the entity and the edit?
- PUTs (updates) to entities
