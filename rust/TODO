x re-generate OpenAPI
    => using whatever sagger-codegen 2.3.1 (stable?)
    => take iron example from older generator 2.3.1 (iron)
    => cargo swagger (docker) seems to only use latest
- integrate API server example into a main.rs
- iron-slog
- get and post for creators

then:
- encode the remaining entities in SQL
- openapi for other entities (heavily templated)


later:
- metrics, jwt, config, sentry, testing
