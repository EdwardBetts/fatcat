correctness
- enforce "previous_rev" required in updates
- reread/review editgroup accept code
- enforce "no editing if editgroup accepted" behavior
- changelog sequence without gaps
- batch insert editgroup behavior; always a new editgroup?
- redirect rev_id needs to be updated when primary changes

edit lifecycle
- editgroup: state to track review status?
- per-edit extra JSON

account helper tool
- set admin bit
- create editors
- create keypairs
- generate tokens
- test/validate tokens

later:
- could some of the EntityCrud trait macro stuff be re-implemented as an enum type?
- pure-rust "benchmark" scripts that hit, eg, lookups and batch endpoints
    => criterion.rs benchmarking
- try new actix/openapi3 codegen branch
- refactor logging; use slog
- test using hash indexes for some UUID column indexes, or at least sha1 and
  other hashes (abstracts, file lookups)

schema/api questions:
- url table (for files)
- get works/releases by creator
- "types"
- define release field stuff
- what should entity POST return? include both the entity and the edit?
