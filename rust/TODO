x re-generate OpenAPI
    => using whatever sagger-codegen 2.3.1 (stable?)
    => take iron example from older generator 2.3.1 (iron)
    => cargo swagger (docker) seems to only use latest
x iron-slog
x integrate API server example into a main.rs
x get and post for creators
x cleanup pooled database: https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/pull/1466
x clean up blasse error handling a bit
x add 404s to gets
x wow. fix a bunch of api schema names ("FindASingleContainerByExternalIdentifer")
x refactor handlers to have a proper Result<_,_> error-chain type, so I can use '?'
- one-to-many relationship (eg, works)
- many-to-many relationship (eg, creators)
- creators, releases, works, files (?)
- copypasta a bunch of CRUD
- helper to calculate state of idents

then:
x encode the remaining entities in SQL
x openapi for other entities (heavily templated)
- figure out JSON(B) in both swagger and diesel

later:
- metrics, jwt, config, sentry, testing
