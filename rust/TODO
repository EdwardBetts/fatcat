x re-generate OpenAPI
    => using whatever sagger-codegen 2.3.1 (stable?)
    => take iron example from older generator 2.3.1 (iron)
    => cargo swagger (docker) seems to only use latest
x iron-slog
x integrate API server example into a main.rs
- get and post for creators
- cleanup pooled database: https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/pull/1466

then:
- encode the remaining entities in SQL
- openapi for other entities (heavily templated)


later:
- metrics, jwt, config, sentry, testing
