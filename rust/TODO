verbs:
- enforce "previous_rev" required in updates

- review editgroup accept code (?)
- fatcat_api -> fatcat_api_schema (or spec? models? types?)
- generally, standardize "edit" actions
- fatcat -> fatcat-api-server
- editgroup param to update
    => also for creation? for consistency
- editor_id vs. editor username; return editor_id (in addition to name?)

later:
- have editgroup_id be a request-level param everywhere (not entity-level; for batch)
- editgroup: state to track review status?
- re-implement old python tests
- enforce "no editing if editgroup accepted" behavior
- real auth
- metrics, jwt, config, sentry
- ansible/deployment/DNS story
- refactor logging; use slog

schema/api questions:
- url table (for files)
- get works/releases by creator
- "types"
- define release field stuff
- what should entity POST return? include both the entity and the edit?
