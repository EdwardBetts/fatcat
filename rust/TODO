x re-generate OpenAPI
    => using whatever sagger-codegen 2.3.1 (stable?)
    => take iron example from older generator 2.3.1 (iron)
    => cargo swagger (docker) seems to only use latest
x iron-slog
x integrate API server example into a main.rs
x get and post for creators
x cleanup pooled database: https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/pull/1466
x clean up blasse error handling a bit
x add 404s to gets
x wow. fix a bunch of api schema names ("FindASingleContainerByExternalIdentifer")
x refactor handlers to have a proper Result<_,_> error-chain type, so I can use '?'
x move python to subdirectory
x rename binary
x copypasta a bunch of CRUD
x swagger endpoint
x helper to calculate 'state' of idents
x tests for orcid and issn lookups
x editgroup helper (for POST)
x creators, releases, works, files
x editgroup accept
x edits, groups, etc
x JSON
x one-to-many relationship (eg, works)
x more dummy data (tests the schema)
x encode the remaining entities in SQL
x openapi for other entities (heavily templated)
x testing framework
x file/release relation
x refactor tests (response check, setup)
x better test coverage (all entity types, get and post)
x editgroup GET API schema arrays

- editor_id vs. editor; can't GET by id, so need to return username?

later:
- generate python client library?
- web interface?
- editgroup: state to track review status?
- all those python tests
- enforce "no editing if editgroup accepted" behavior
- refactor entity creation/editing (DRY)
- refactor to allow Result<> in all handlers
- real auth
- metrics, jwt, config, sentry
- ansible/deployment/DNS story
- refactor logging; use slog

schema/api questions:
- url table (for files)
- get works/releases by creator
- "types"
- define release field stuff
- what should entity POST return? include both the entity and the edit?
- PUTs (updates) to entities
