A few "demo" entities which are useful examples of fatcat features.

Brainstorm list:
- distill.pub: rich/interactive web-native content
- d-lib: simple, archival (discontinued) web-native content
- eLife JATS files (XML)
- examples of work/release/file distinctions. AKA, pre-print and version of record; multiple publications; retractions; multiple files of different formats/waterprints
- "fake" works (like academic stings and example items)
- open access ebooks
- "famous" greylit
- scholarly blog posts: web-native content
- webarchive-only works (eg, Genders and Exquisite Corpse)
