# High-Level Overview

This section gives an introduction to:

- the goals of the project, and now it relates to the rest of the Open Access
  and archival ecosystem
- how catalog data is represented as entities and revisions with full edit
  history, and how entities are referred to and cross-referenced with
  identifiers
- how humans and bots propose changes to the catalog, and how these changes are
  reviewed
- the major sources of bulk and continuously updated metadata that form the
  foundation of the catalog
- a rough sketch of the software back-end, database, and libraries
- roadmap for near-future work
