# Fatcat Overview

fatcat is an open bibliographic catalog of written works.  The scope of works
is somewhat flexible, with a focus on published research outputs like journal
articles, pre-prints, and conference proceedings. Records are collaboratively
editable, versioned, available in bulk form, and include URL-agnostic
file-level metadata.

fatcat is currently used internally at the Internet Archive, but interested
folks are welcome to contribute to design and development.
