However, empirical syntheses relating these processes to spatio-temporal patterns of structure in metacommunities remains elusive. One important reason for this lack of synthesis is that the relative importance of the core assembly processes (dispersal, selection and drift) critically depends on the spatial grain and extent over which communities are studied. To illustrate this, we simulated different aspects of community assembly on heterogeneous landscapes, including the strength of response to environmental heterogeneity (inherent to niche theory) versus dispersal and stochastic drift (inherent to neutral theory). We show that increasing spatial extent leads to increasing importance of niche selection, whereas increasing spatial grain leads to decreasing importance of niche selection. The strength of these scaling effects depended on environment configuration, dispersal capacity and niche breadth. By mapping the variation observed from the scaling effects in simulations, we could recreate the entire range of variation observed within and among empirical studies. This means that variation in the relative importance of assembly processes among empirical studies is largely scale dependent and cannot be directly compared. The scaling coefficient of the relative contribution of assembly processes, however, can be interpreted as a scale-integrative estimate to compare assembly processes across different regions and ecosystems. This emphasizes the necessity to consider spatial scaling as an explicit component of studies intended to infer the importance of community assembly processes. This article is protected by copyright.

Typically, these methods consider one dimension, rows or columns, that is shared among the matrices. This shared dimension may represent common features measured for different sample sets (horizontal integration) or a common sample set with features from different platforms (vertical integration). We introduce an approach for simultaneous horizontal and vertical integration, Linked Matrix Factorization (LMF), for the general case where some matrices share rows (e.g., features) and some share columns (e.g., samples). Our motivating application is a cytotoxicity study with accompanying genomic and molecular chemical attribute data. The toxicity matrix (cell lines\u2009\u00d7\u2009chemicals) shares samples with a genotype matrix (cell lines\u2009\u00d7\u2009SNPs) and shares features with a molecular attribute matrix (chemicals\u2009\u00d7\u2009attributes). LMF gives a unified low-rank factorization of these three matrices, which allows for the decomposition of systematic variation that is shared and systematic variation that is specific to each matrix. This allows for efficient dimension reduction, exploratory visualization, and the imputation of missing data even when entire rows or columns are missing. We present theoretical results concerning the uniqueness, identifiability, and minimal parametrization of LMF, and evaluate it with extensive simulation studies.

By contrast, the role of recurrent pulse perturbations, such as extreme climatic events, has been largely neglected, hindering our understanding of how historical processes regulate the onset of a regime shift. We performed field manipulations to evaluate whether combinations of extreme events of temperature and sediment deposition that differed in their degree of temporal clustering generated alternative states in rocky intertidal epilithic microphytobenthos (biofilms) on rocky shores. The likelihood of biofilms to shift from a vegetated to a bare state depended on the degree of temporal clustering of events, with biofilm biomass showing both states under a regime of non-clustered (60 days apart) perturbations while collapsing in the clustered (15 days apart) scenario. Our results indicate that time since the last perturbation can be an important predictor of collapse in systems exhibiting alternative states and that consideration of historical effects in studies of regime shifts may largely improve our understanding of ecosystem dynamics under climate change.

While fine-scale experiments tend to yield the predicted negative association between diversity and invasibility, broad-scale observational surveys generally report a positive correlation. This conflicting pattern between experiments and observational studies is referred to as the invasion paradox, and is thought to arise because different processes control species composition at different spatial scales. Here, we test empirically the extent to which the strength and direction of published diversity-invasibility relationships depend on spatial scale and on the metrics used to measure invasibility. Using a meta-analytic framework, we explicitly separate the two components of spatial scale: grain and extent, by focusing on fine-grain studies that vary in extent. We find evidence of multiple drivers of the paradox. When we consider only fine-grain studies, we still observe conflicting patterns between experiments and observational studies. In contrast, when we examine studies that are conducted at both a fine grain and fine extent, there is broad overlap in effect sizes between experiments and observation, suggesting that comparing studies with similar extents resolves the paradox at local scales. However, we uncover systematic differences in the metrics used to measure invasibility between experiments, which use predominantly invader performance, and observational studies, which use mainly invader richness. When we consider studies with the same metric (i.e., invader performance), the contrasting associations between study types also disappears. It is not possible, at present, to fully disentangle the effect of spatial extent and metric on the paradox because both variables are systematically associated in different directions with study type. There is therefore an urgent need to conduct experiments and observational studies that incorporate the full range of variability in spatial extent and invasibility metric.

This approach inevitably assumes that the partitioning of total plant species richness into above- and belowground components is constant or at least consistent within and across vegetation types. However, with studies considering belowground plant richness still scarce and completely absent along vegetation gradients, this assumption lacks experimental support. Novel DNA sequencing techniques allow economical, high-throughput species identification of belowground environmental samples, enabling the measurement of the contributions of both above- and belowground plant components to total plant richness. We investigated above- and belowground plant species richness in four vegetation types (birch forest, heath, low alpine tundra, high alpine tundra) at the scale of herbaceous plant neighborhoods (dm) using 454 sequencing of the chloroplast trnL (UAA) intron to determine the plant species richness of environmental root samples and combined it with aboveground data from vegetation surveys to obtain total plant species richness. We correlated the measured plant species richness components with each other and with their respective plant biomass components within and across vegetation types. Total plant species richness exceeded aboveground richness twice on average and by as much as three times in low alpine tundra, indicating that a significant fraction of belowground plant richness cannot be recorded aboveground. More importantly, no consistent relationship among richness components (above- and belowground) was found within or across vegetation types, indicating that aboveground richness alone cannot predict total plant richness in contrasting vegetation types. Finally, no consistent relationship between plant richness and the corresponding biomass component was found. Our results clearly show that aboveground plant richness alone is a poor estimator of total plant species richness within and across different vegetation types. Consequently, it is crucial to account for belowground plant richness in future plant ecological studies in order to validate currently accepted plant richness patterns, as well as to measure potential changes in plant community composition in a changing environment.
