In (5), lemma 4.6., p. 42, R. Hartshorne has proved that, under certain conditions, a cochain complex X\u02d9 \u03b5. |KA)| can be embedded in a complex I\u02d9 \u03b5. |K(I)| in such a way that I\u02d9 has the same cohomology as X\u02d9.  In Chapter I we show that the construction given in the two first parts of Hartshorne's Lemma is natural i.e. there exists a functor  J : K(A) \u2192 K(I) and a natural transformation [formula omitted]  (where E : K(I) \u2192 K(A) is the embedding functor) such that [formula omitted] is  injective and induces isomorphism in cohomology. The question whether the construction given in the third part of the lemma is functorial is still open.  We also prove that J is left adjoint to E, so that K(I) is a reflective subcategory of K(A).  In the special case where A is a category [formula omitted] of left A-modules, and [formula omitted] the category of cochain complexes in [formula omitted] and cochain maps (not homotopy classes), we prove the existence of a functor [formula omitted]  In Chapter II we study the natural homomorphism [formula omitted]   where A, B are rings, and M, L, N modules or chain complexes. In particular we give several sufficient conditions under which v is an isomorphism, or induces isomorphism in homology.  In the appendix we give a detailed proof of Hartshorne's Lemma. We think that this is useful, as no complete proof is, to our knowledge, to be found in the literature.",
