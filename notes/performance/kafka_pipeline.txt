## Early Notes (2018-11-13)

Ran through about 100k crossref objects, resulting in about 77k messages (in
about 4k editgroups/changelogs).

Have seen tens of messages per second go through trivially.

The elastic-release worker is the current bottleneck, only some 4.3
messages/second. Because this worker consumes from 8x partitions, I have a
feeling it might be consumer group related. kafka-manager shows "0% coverage"
for this topic. Note that this is a single worker process.

_consumer_offsets is seeing about 36 messages/sec.

Oh, looks like I just needed to enable auto_commit and tune parameters in
pykafka!
