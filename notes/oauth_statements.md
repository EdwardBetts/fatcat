## Wikimedia

Fatcat (https://fatcat.wiki) is a publicly-editable bibliographic catalog, containing metadata about tens of millions of research articles, conference proceedings, and books. The particular emphasis is on linking different "releases" of the same "work" (eg, preprint and final copies of a journal paper), and matching specific (archived) files to releases.
Fatcat is a project of the Internet Archive (https://archive.org).
