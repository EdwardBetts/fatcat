For users: use openid connect (oauth2) to sign up and login to web app. From
web app, can create (and disable?) API tokens

For impl: fatcat-web has private key to create tokens. tokens used both in
cookies and as API keys. tokens are macaroons (?). fatcatd only verifies
tokens. optionally, some redis or other fast shared store to verify that tokens
haven't been revoked.

Could use portier with openid connect as an email-based option. Otherwise,
orcid, github, google.
