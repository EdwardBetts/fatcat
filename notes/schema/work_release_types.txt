crossref non-work types (don't need mappings; don't import? as containers?
    two-layers of containers?)
- book-series
- book-set
- book-track
- journal (definitely not release)
- journal-issue
- journal-volume
- proceedings (definitely not release)
- proceedings-series

release statuses should align with DRIVER guidelines, which are:

- draft: Early version circulated as work in progress
- submittedVersion: The version that has been submitted to a journal for peer review
- acceptedVersion: The author-created version that incorporates referee comments and is the accepted for publication version
- publishedVersion: The publisher created published version
- updatedVersion: A version updated since publication

Proposed fatcat vocabulary:

- draft
- submitted: aka, pre-print, "under review"
- accepted: aka, post-print, author's manuscript, "publisher's proof", "post-print"
- published: the version that the publisher distributes. may include minor
  (gramatical, typographical, broken link, aesthetic) corrections. AKA,
  "version of record", "final publication version".
- updated: post-publication significant updates (considered a separate release
  in fatcat). AKA, "correction" (in the context of "correction notice", or the
  full new version)

The term "working paper" can be ambiguous; in some contexts it is a draft, in
some submitted (pre-print).

TODO: retractions (of published works, by author or publisher/editor) and
withdrawls (of un-published but released/submitted works). are these a separate
release, separate flag ("is_retracted"), or status type? if status, is it
"-retracted", eg, "published-retracted", or just "retracted"? should fatcat
point to the specific retraction release/object? that would include, eg, the
date, and other metadata.

I think a "withdrawn_date" schema field, in combination with "retraction"
release type and status, is probably best. If pre-publication, only set
withdrawn date. If post-publication, set the withdrawn_date and also create a
retraction release under the same work (with appropriate status and/or type).
But maybe "is_withdrawn" in case date isn't known?
