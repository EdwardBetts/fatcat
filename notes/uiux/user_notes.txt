## 2019-04-19: Jefferson, creating a release

Was able to login and get started on his own. Ran through form mostly fine;
wanted to hunt down volume/issue but didn't make sense. Single author. Pasted
title into "Original Title" when not needed, but then removed. Initially
entered date with slashes (not dashes). Didn't enter edit comments. Recognized
that the red asterisks were required.

Distractions:

- Original Title should clarify language distinction
- FCID. (some better UI for these?)

Inability to "go back" and edit is a thing. After creating he tried to click
"edit metadata" and got an error. Unclear how to get to recent edits (I showed
him in upper-right). Wanted to add references ("just paste these in?"), and/or
a web capture.

Indirect (my thoughts while watching, but user didn't interact with or
mention):

- the mix of "label on left" and "label above" is confusing
- input boxes could be smaller and a bit less padding (?)
- no indication of "entirely optional"
- nowhere to enter bare container name (probably common?)
