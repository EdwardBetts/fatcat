# CHANGELOG

Notable technical changes to the fatcat schemas, Rust API server, Python web
interface, and Python client library will be recorded here.

Intent is to follow semantic versioning, with all components kept in lock-step,
but note that everything is pre-1.0, so there aren't any actual backwards
compatibility guarantees. The API prefix (eg, `/v0/`) will probably roughly
track major version number, but TBD.

## [Unreleased]

Intent is to tag a [0.2.0] release really soon now, as a first public version.
